I am a master's student at Arizona State University studying Software Engineering. My interests include web services, machine learning, and robotics. I am currently conducting research for my graduate thesis under Dr. Ajay Bansal applying machine learning to the field of Astronomy. I spend my down time on weekends as a volunteer referee at VEX robotics compeitions locally in Arizona and tinkering with my homelab.
